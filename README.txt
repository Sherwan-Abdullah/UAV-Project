# UAV-Project
This is the data logger of a UAV-based system to record the RAN (Radio Access Network of a mobile service provider) and End-to-End network performance (Delay and Throughput). The folders are arranged as below:

- Data_Set: contains the log files of the test performed with a variety of scenarios
- Python_Scripts: contain the scripts of how this project is working
    - Logging: contains the Python scripts that log records the metric
    - data_extract: contains the Python scripts that extract the wanted parameters from the log files and arrange them into CSV text files
    - visualize_data: contains the Python scripts that plot the data either to 2D+3D maps or statistical charts

Inside each folder, you will find a README file that contains more information
