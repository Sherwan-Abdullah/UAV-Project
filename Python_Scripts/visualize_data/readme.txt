The script files are to plot the metrics of:

- RAN_map_2D3D.py maps the serving cell RAN metrics (RSRP, RSRQ, RSSI, and SINR) into a 4X2 HTML file each metric is plotted in 2D and 3D views.
- RAN_statistics.py: plots the serving cell RAN metrics (RSRP, RSRQ, RSSI, and SINR) into PNG images


- Delay_statistics.py: plots the PDF of RTT (between the Radio modem and a dedicated server) into PNG images.


- throughput_statistics.py: plots the CDF of bidirectional throughput (uplink and downlink) into PNG images.
